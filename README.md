  # Vehicle Builder
  
  ## Description
  **What:**
- This allows the user to either create a new vehicle or select an existing one.

- After completing the creation or selection process, the user can perform various actions with the selected vehicle.

-  Once an action is completed, the user is returned to the actions menu, where they can continue interacting with the application or choose to exit.

**How:**
- I'm updating an existing application to include vehicle types.

**Why:**
- So the User can create a new vehicle or select an existing one.

**How was this project built:**
- I modified the starter code and I also downloaded my README Generator file to help me generate a README file.

  ## Installation
  In order to run this application, you must have node.js installed in your computer. If you don't have it installed yet, you can head over to [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en).

  


  
  ## Usage
  **How the prompts work:**

_The User will be given a command-line application that accepts the User Input._

1. When the User is prompted to create a new vehicle, or an existing vehicle, then they can choose between two options
2. When the User is prompted to choose the vehicle type during creation, then they can choose between car, truck, and motorbike
3. When the User is prompted for the details about the vehicle, then they can the vehicle information
4. Once the User have entered all the vehicle information, then they can use the created vehicle
5. If the User selects an existing vehicle, then they can perform actions with that vehicle
6. When the User performs an action with a vehicle, then they can see the result in the command-line
7. Then once the User completes the process of performing an action, then they can perform additional actions until they choose to exit
